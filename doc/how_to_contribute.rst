How to Ð¡ontribute
##########################################

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and you always earn credits.

You can contribute on the code side in many ways:

* submit feedback,
* add new features,
* report bugs,
* fix bugs,
* implement a new cluster/cloud computation backend,
* write documentation


Code
====

Linting and pre-commit
----------------------
For every code contribution you should run `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/index.html>`_.
This will lint, format and check your code contributions against our guidelines
(e.g. we use `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ as code style
and aim for `REUSE compliance <https://reuse.software/>`_):

1. Installation ``conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit`` or ``pip install pre-commit``
2. Usage:
  * To automatically activate ``pre-commit`` on every ``git commit``: Run ``pre-commit install``
  * To manually run it: ``pre-commit run --all``

Testing
-------
Add a new test if you want to contribute new functionality to the config.
We perform currently *multiple* integration tests which means various workflows need to work.
All test configs are build by updating the ``config.tutorial.yaml`` with the configs in ``pypysa-earth/test/*.yaml``.

  * You can test your contribution locally with ``make test``.
  * See the Makefile for further information which configurations are tested.

To contribute a test:

1. Provide a new test in ``test/<new test>.yaml``, or adjust one of the existing ones. These tests update the config.tutorial.yaml to test other options e.g. landlock countries.
2. Add a new test config path to the ``rule build_all_test`` in the ``Snakefile``.
3. If your functionality should be tested in the CI for every pull request, add a respective code in ``.github/workflows/ci-linux.yaml``. We test all functionalities only for Linux while providing a general test for windows and mac.

Performance-profiling
---------------------
Performance profiling is important to understand bottlenecks and
the accordingly optimize the speed in PyPSA-Earth. We use the Python built-in
`cProfiler`, custom decorators on single functions and analysis tools
like `snakeviz <https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/>`_. See a detailed example
in `this discussion #557 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/discussions/557>`_.


Documentation
-------------

To create the documentation locally, you need `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_ . It can be installed using specifications
from `doc/requirements.txt`. First, we recommend creating a fresh conda environment and activate it:

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % conda create --name pypsa-earth-docs python

    .../pypsa-earth % conda activate pypsa-earth-docs

Next, install the packages specified in `doc/requirements.txt` using `pip`:

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % pip install -r doc/requirements.txt


Once installation is completed, the following commands allow you to create the documentation locally:

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth (pypsa-earth-docs) % cd doc

    .../pypsa-earth/doc (pypsa-earth-docs) % make html

This will create html files in `pypsa-earth/doc/_build/html`.
VScode provides a so called Liveserver extension such that the html file can be opened locally on your computer.

.. warning::

    Windows users might face some challenges when building the documentation locally using `make`. A workaround can be found, but might be time consuming. For instance:

    1. If using Windows PowerShell, one might need to replace the command `make html` above by `./make html`. For more details on what is going on, see `this post <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65471557/make-html-not-working-for-sphinx-documentation-in-windows-10>`_ on Stack Overflow.

.. note::

    The documentation is built automatically by the CI for every pull request. The documentation is hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
    For more information on our documentation infrastructure and syntax tips, see `this page <https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_docs.html>`_.
